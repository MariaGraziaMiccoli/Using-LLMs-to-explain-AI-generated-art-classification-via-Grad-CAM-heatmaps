# Using LLMs to Explain AI-Generated Art Classification via Grad-CAM Heatmaps

## Introduction

This project aims to improve the explainability of Transformer-based image classification models used to distinguish between original and AI-generated artworks. By leveraging Grad-CAM heatmaps, we explored how large language models (LLMs) can provide insightful explanations of the model's decisions.

The starting point was Bianco et al.'s work *Identifying AI-Generated Art with Deep Learning*, which utilized models such as VGG-19, ResNet-50, and ViT for classification tasks. We used their dataset, available [here](https://github.com/CILAB-ArtGraph/Art-fake-recognition).

## Models Used

We evaluated three advanced LLMs:

- [**LLaVa-NeXt**](https://huggingface.co/LLaVA)
- [**InstructBLIP**](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/instructblip)
- [**KOSMOS-2**](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/kosmos-2)

## Dataset

The dataset comprises a subset of Bianco et al.'s original data, including:

- 50 AI-generated artworks.
- 50 original artworks.
- Each image is paired with:
  - The original artwork.
  - The Grad-CAM heatmap overlay.
  - The classification label ("Original" or "Generated by AI").

## Results

### Qualitative Analysis

- **LLaVa-NeXt**: Provided the most coherent and insightful explanations, particularly for AI-generated artworks.
- **InstructBLIP**: Misinterpreted heatmaps as thermal images, leading to irrelevant explanations.
- **KOSMOS-2**: Identified areas of interest but often delivered vague descriptions.

### Quantitative Analysis

Using CLIP and S-BERT, we measured the similarity between the generated captions, the images, and their respective labels. Despite slightly lower quantitative scores, **LLaVa-NeXt** was the best in delivering meaningful explanations.

## Presentation
This project was presented at the **XAI.IT** workshop, part of the **AIxIA 2024** conference in Bolzano, Italy.
